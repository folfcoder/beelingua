## Notes

Please don't abuse this script. Use it wisely and only when you're stuck. Don't use it to cheat on your exercises. I'm not responsible for any consequences that may occur if you use this script to cheat.

## Limitations

- It could break at any time if Beelingua changes their website.
- The script currently works on exercises that have multiple choice answers.
- Dependent on the API. If the API is down, the script won't work.
